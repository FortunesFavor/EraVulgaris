High Concept                -  Cohekkon:Ra Cabin Boy
        Being one of the younger members of the crew, in both age and sinority (SP), has ensured what respect he does have was earned through hard work and being useful.  Being the only male on the crew hasn't helped matters either, as quite a few of his tasks include cleaning up after Lizzy like a personal servent or trying to avoid being groped at less then optimal times by some other member of the crew.  I life of both has ensured he is quite good at keeping at least a tiny bit of order around the choas that is Lizzy. 

Ambition Aspect					    -  Shadowbroker
        Information is power, something Tesh learned from the moment he was 'freed.'  His first true master used to trade information as freely as one would wealth of other sorts, often commisioning something called 'deckers' to seek out information that could be sold, or aquire prototypes and other items of research that garnished a high price on the markets.  Even though it got the old man killed in the end, Tesh knows it can end differently if he is better at it then his mentor.

    At the time of implantation, the bases of these networks where still experemental and carried a high casualty rate. Thanks to the experementations themselves this problem has been resolved and humans can be safely implanted at a far more acceptable faulure rate. That doesn't make them any cheaper though, and price ensures they are only available to high end milatary and corporate divisions and this one curiousity.
