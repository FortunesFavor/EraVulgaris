High Concept                -  Cohekkon:Ra Cabin Boy
        Being one of the younger members of the crew, in both age and sinority (SP), has ensured what respect he does have was earned through hard work and being useful.  Being the only male on the crew hasn't helped matters either, as quite a few of his tasks include cleaning up after Lizzy like a personal servent or trying to avoid being groped at less then optimal times by some other member of the crew.  I life of both has ensured he is quite good at keeping at least a tiny bit of order around the choas that is Lizzy. 

Ambition Aspect					    -  Shadowbroker
        Information is power, something Tesh learned from the moment he was 'freed.'  His first true master used to trade information as freely as one would wealth of other sorts, often commisioning something called 'deckers' to seek out information that could be sold, or aquire prototypes and other items of research that garnished a high price on the markets.  Even though it got the old man killed in the end, Tesh knows it can end differently if he is better at it then his mentor.  

Background Aspect				    -  Unethical Research
        It is not unknown for children to be sold into slavery even though it is greatly frowned on, even into a short existance as some sort of test subject.  Most of the time no one cares, talking about it only in the shadows, and when it happens to another race it is even less worthy of public discussion.  That was the start of Tesh's life, as he was removed from family and home before he was even a full three years old.  The following year or two, he doesn't know for certain, his skull was repeativly cracked open and electrodes inserted to try and bridge the nural network of his kind and machines.  If it wasn't for circumstances and luck, he would likely be just as dead as the other test subjects.  
        All so his kind could be better weaponized and enslaved, being able to release a human based version of the network was just a bonus.... 
        
Conviction Aspect				    -  Every Secret has a Price
        Only once has he made the mistake of not building a network of favours, debts and wealth for the information he has been able to track down.  That was when he was first rescued and he turned over the ships data-cores to Lizzy without even asking for anything in return, not even knowing what data he had just handed to an unknown pirate.  Now if one wants his services above his normal duties to Lizzy as a member of the crew, they will need to find some way to pay him for it and many owe small favours to him already. 
        
Disadvantage Aspect			    -  The Uncertain Mind Principle 
        Like most youths, he has uncertainties about his place in the universe and even with the headstart into adulthood he can't escape it.  There will always be that second voice at the back of his head telling him how much he has screwed up and a third voice telling him what Lizzy will think about it.  This might sometime lead to rash actions that he believes will be well recieved, more so if Lizzy is involved as he does have a tiny crash on the first female he shared a bed with.   
        
Exceptional Skill Aspect		-  Hack the Gibson 
      To call him a hacker would be an insult, as what he has learned to do is more like poetry in action.  Computer code obeys his whim, his thought paterns themselves small networks themselves and even the starnet is tapped as if he was a thirsty traveller at a well.  Enough systems have felt his mind inside of them, often without being detected, that he has a curious theory that the starnet is a little... too well designed. 
      
Foe Aspect					        -  Wanted Dead or Dead 
      There where meant to be no traces of whom carried out the assassination of his old man back to the group which carried it out, for both for the party and the Jhonson.  Needless to say, the existance of a survivor and some fottage of the hit itself has made the warlord whom carried it out a few corporate enemeies.  That has in turned ensured there is a grudge between said warlord and Tesh, and a sizable bounty to go along with it.  It isn't much of a problem when your part of a pirate crew, most of the members have bounties from the warlords or some corporate body, but it still is out there.  

Gear Aspect					        -  Military Grade Neuro-Uplink
      At the time of implantation, the bases of these networks where still experemental and carried a high casualty rate. Thanks to the experementations themselves this problem has been resolved and humans can be safely implanted at a far more acceptable faulure rate. That doesn't make them any cheaper though, and price ensures they are only available to high end milatary and corporate divisions and this one curiousity.  
    
Help Aspect				        	-  Spies, Spies everywhere
      Either through previous favours and agreements he has earned, or through some of the connectoins of his old man, there is very little he can not eventually track down.  A few key words in the right ears could unlock the door to a server for a few hours, or lock out the local law enforcement, which is why he is kept around.  There are a few hidden game servers with slaved commands to access government databases out there, just to make the job more entertaining. 

Inferior Skill Aspect				-  *Bang* - Miss. 
      Just being part of a pirate crew doesn't mean you can shoot straight and plunder enemy ships, and Tesh is testimony to that fact.  Anywhere in front of his gun is a dangerous place to be when he pulls the trigger, and even behind the gun is not a guarenteed safe spot.  The crew often talk about his many attempts at the firing range, and how he has somehow managed a 45 degress of accuracy using frame mounted weapons.

Health 	   [Healthy] [Injured] [Wounded] [Incapacitated]

Edge       [1]
  
Body        4
  Natural Weapons             3
        A mixture of instincts, senses and natural weapons allow him to operate fairly effectively in hand to hand combat even though he lacks any formal training.  A skilled martial artest could merge his style into another with enough time, but for now he is brutal and over-reaching with many of his attacks.  
  Brute Strength              2
        A cat in space is only as good as his genetics as much of the training they enture requires their strong gravity.  As Tesh has had a life in space, he is unable to carry the same impressive amounts as others of his kind.  This doesn't make him as weak as a cub, just a little under normal for a human of his size and build.  
  Athletics                   8
        Those genes are quite good and space has not been able to diminish his training when it comes to flexibility.  There is a rumor on the ship that a cat is more then able to suck himself off, a feat that he has demostraited once or twice.  Near absolute control of his balance, the ability to dig his claws into the walls and a longer endurance then a normal human make him a peek athlete without any dedicated training.  

Reflexes    5		 
  Dodge                       8
        While he will fire his weapon, he would rather find something to duck behind and let the bullets go by.  It does give him a little bit of an edge when it comes to dodging shots that come close to hitting their mark.  
  Firearms                    3
        Enough time has been spent at ranges and with people whom can handle firearms.  Even though he has failed completely to learn what they are trying to teach, at least they trust him enough to know he will point the right end at the enemy. 
  Stealth                     6
        Interestingtly it isn't the dark fur that gives him the edge, though it doesn't hurt, but the different form he has to a human silluete.  Eyes skilled at pulling human shapes from shadows need a second glace over pointed ears and a muzzle, which might be enough to get further out of sight and out of mind.  
        
Wits        5
  Hacking                     10
        Needless to say, there is no better in the world... or at least none he knows. 
  Perception                  8
        Keen Feline senses allow him to hear and see more of his surroundings, even his whiskers bring in data that his fast mind can process and follow.  
  Gather Information          8
        Mostly used in local networks to quickly find information that might be valuable to the mission, a client or just a data-storage.  These skills do have some in the field applications, locating locations where informaiton can be traded freely or a jhon can be met in seclusion.  

Persona      5			
  Negotiation                 10
        The main reason he is kept on board and a good deal of Lizzy's contacts go through him, he is polite and well behaved where the captain is anything but.  It is far easier to get a deal with Lizzy by making it with him, and Lizzy in turn knows the price for said deal will be satisfying.   
  Sense Deception             10
        It is just something about people that he seems to understand, maybe their body language is easier to read, but whatever it is he can tell when someone is lying or misleading him even when they do not intentonally mean to do so.  This does ensure he is never at poker games, or if he does any sort of gambling it is for the crew as a whole which is a profitable con.   
  Silver-Tongue                4
        When something can not be purchased through bartered it can still be aquired through the right words.  Given that a lot of things are not reasonably for sale, mostly price being an issue, it is a good talent to know when to whisper softly and when to apply that tongue ever so gently.
