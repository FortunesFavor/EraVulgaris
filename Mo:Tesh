    At the time of implantation, the bases of these networks where still experemental and carried a high casualty rate.  Thanks to the experementations themselves this problem has been resolved and humans can be safely implanted at a far more acceptable faulure rate. That doesn't make them any cheaper though, and price ensures they are only available to high end milatary and corporate divisions and this one curiousity.
