High Concept                -  Cohekkon:Ra Cabin Boy
        Being one of the younger members of the crew, in both age and sinority (SP), has ensured what respect he does have was earned through hard work and being useful.  Being the only male on the crew hasn't helped matters either, as quite a few of his tasks include cleaning up after Lizzy like a personal servent or trying to avoid being groped at less then optimal times by some other member of the crew.  I life of both has ensured he is quite good at keeping at least a tiny bit of order around the choas that is Lizzy. 

Ambition Aspect					    -  Shadowbroker
        Information is power, something Tesh learned from the moment he was 'freed.'  His first true master used to trade information as freely as one would wealth of other sorts, often commisioning something called 'deckers' to seek out information that could be sold, or aquire prototypes and other items of research that garnished a high price on the markets.  Even though it got the old man killed in the end, Tesh knows it can end differently if he is better at it then his mentor.  

Background Aspect				    -  Sold at an early age
        It is not unknown for children to be sold into slavery even though it is greatly frowned on, even into a short existance as some sort of test subject.  Most of the time no one cares, talking about it only in the shadows, and when it happens to another race it is even less worthy of public discussion.  That was the start of Tesh's life, as he was removed from family and home before he was even a full three years old.  The following year or two, he doesn't know for certain, his skull was repeativly cracked open and electrodes inserted to try and bridge the nural network of his kind and machines.  If it wasn't for circumstances and luck, he would likely be just as dead as the other test subjects.  
        All so his kind could be better weaponized and enslaved, being able to release a human based version of the network was just a bonus.... 
Conviction Aspect				    -  I find it for a price
        Only once has he made the mistake of not building a network of favours, debts and wealth for the information he has been able to track down.  That was when he was first rescued and he turned over the ships data-cores to Lizzy without even asking for anything in return, not even knowing what data he had just handed to an unknown pirate.  Now if one wants his services above his normal duties to Lizzy as a member of the crew, they will need to find some way to pay him for it and many owe small favours to him already. 
Disadvantage Aspect			    -  Seeks to prove himself
        Like most youths, he has uncertainties about his place in the universe and even with the headstart into adulthood he can't escape it.  There will always be that second voice at the back of his head telling him how much he has screwed up and a third voice telling him what Lizzy will think about it.  This might sometime lead to rash actions that he believes will be well recieved, more so if Lizzy is involved as he does have a tiny crash on the first person he shared a bed with.   
Exceptional Skill Aspect		-  Hacking the Gibson 
Foe Aspect					        -  Survivor of warlord
Gear Aspect					        -  Military Grade Neuro-Uplink
    At the time of implantation, the bases of these networks where still experemental and carried a high casualty rate. Thanks to the experementations themselves this problem has been resolved and humans can be safely implanted at a far more acceptable faulure rate. That doesn't make them any cheaper though, and price ensures they are only available to high end milatary and corporate divisions and this one curiousity.
